# Connect4WithAI
APCS Final Project

This is my APCS Final Project. It is Connect 4 with an AI. You can also chose to play against another player locally. The AI has 3 difficuly levels, all using the MiniMax algorithm. The harder levels look further in advance to predict and figure out where to drop its piece. 

The GUI was creating using a 2D Game Java library called Slick 2D. There are 3 stages, the main menu stage, the instruction stage, and finally the playing stage.
